<h1>About me</h1>
<p>I'm zetsu (Gabriel Lima). Brazilian, 19 years old.</p>
<p>When I got the opportunity to build my first computer in november 2022, the first thing that came to my mind was the power that would be given to me. I could finally stop struggling with handwrinting algorithms in pseudo-languages in my notebook and start actually building software.</p>
<p>After a couple of months I was already able to finish my first project: <a href="https://github.com/zetsuHQ/password-generator">password-generator</a>. It felt amazing. Although being a simple client-side application, the feeling of building something from scratch, relying only on my abilities to research, was trully satisfactory.</p>
<p>The experience aquired after that simple project allowed me to see that some of the things I thought were made for genious were actually just a matter of dedication and time, so now cybersecurity seemed a lot closer to my reality.</p>
<p>I believe that programming languages are just tools, not something to be attatched to. Although having JavaScript as my first contact with the field, I won't stop myself from building things that I want, regarding the technology required.</p>
